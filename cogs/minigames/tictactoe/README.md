# Tic-tac-toe

An implementation of tic-tac-toe. The user who issues the `tttstart` command
will be assigned X and be the first to play. Moves are made by reacting to the
bot-generate message, with both players alternating. A game can be stopped at
any time by either player by issuing the `tttstop` command with the opponent's
username.
